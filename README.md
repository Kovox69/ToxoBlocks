# Overview
This repository is part of the supplemental informtaion on [Ribosomal Incorporation of Short RNAs from Mitochondrial Genome Recombination Sites in Toxoplasma gondii](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.02.556019v1).
In brief we identified Toxoplasma gondii mitochondiral coding blocks on nanopore seqeuncing reads and investigated their pairings and orientations.

`/data` contains the extracted annotations from all reads in a .tsv file, further, `raw.txt` has the link to all raw data that was uploaded for this publication  
`/plots` has the generated heatmap, for the publications some minor styling changes were made in adobe photoshop  
`/tables` contains the supplementary .csv files generated by R as well as some restyled .xlsx files
